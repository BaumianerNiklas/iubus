# Iubus

Dead simple discord.js v14 slash command framework. Iubus (from the latin word _iubere_ - "to command, to order") is a simple, barebones framework on top of discord.js for easily dealing with slash commands. The project is still somewhat under development, but I'm hoping to publish this along with when discord.js reaches a stable release.
