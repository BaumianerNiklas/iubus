# Iubus

Dead simple discord.js v14 slash command framework. Iubus (from the latin word _iubere_ - "to command, to order") is a simple, barebones framework on top of discord.js for easily dealing with slash commands.

The project is still under development, but I'm hoping to publish this along with when discord.js reaches a stable release. [This Notion site](https://neoon.notion.site/5c180add7bd94fd2ac52e2465ea2fd33?v=a16babaedf5a4340b7d4c0c45bb7e12e) shows the current progress and planned features.
